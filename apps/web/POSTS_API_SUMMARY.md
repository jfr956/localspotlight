# Google Business Profile Posts API - Implementation Summary

## What Was Implemented

A complete, production-ready Google Business Profile posts system with two main capabilities:

### 1. **Sync Existing Posts** (`POST /api/sync/posts`)
Fetches all existing posts from Google Business Profile and stores them in the database for analytics and reference.

### 2. **Create New Posts** (`POST /api/posts/create`)
Creates and publishes new posts directly to Google Business Profile with full validation and error handling.

## How to Test Creating a Post

### Option 1: Using the Test Script (Recommended)

```bash
# Make sure dev server is running
pnpm dev

# In another terminal, run the direct test
tsx test-posts-direct.ts
```

This will:
1. Find a managed location in your database
2. Fetch existing posts from Google
3. Create a new test post
4. Store it in the database
5. Show you the Google URL to view the post

### Option 2: Using API Endpoint Directly

First, start your dev server:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

Then use curl or any HTTP client:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/posts/create \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "locationId": "your-location-uuid-here",
    "summary": "Check out our amazing new services! We are excited to serve you better.",
    "topicType": "STANDARD",
    "callToAction": {
      "actionType": "LEARN_MORE",
      "url": "https://example.com"
    }
  }'
```

### Option 3: Using the Full Test Script

```bash
tsx test-posts-api.ts
```

This tests both sync and create operations via HTTP.

## Where Posts Data is Stored

### Primary Storage: `gbp_posts` table

All posts (both synced and created) are stored in the `gbp_posts` table:

```sql
gbp_posts
├── id (UUID, primary key)
├── org_id (UUID, with RLS)
├── location_id (UUID, foreign key to gbp_locations)
├── google_post_name (text, full resource name from Google)
├── summary (text, post content)
├── topic_type (text: STANDARD, EVENT, OFFER)
├── call_to_action_type (text)
├── call_to_action_url (text)
├── event_title, event_start_date, event_end_date (for EVENT posts)
├── offer_coupon_code, offer_redeem_url, offer_terms (for OFFER posts)
├── media_urls (text[], array of image URLs)
├── state (text: LIVE, EXPIRED, REJECTED)
├── search_url (text, direct link to view post)
├── meta (jsonb, full raw response from Google)
├── google_create_time (timestamptz)
├── google_update_time (timestamptz)
├── created_at, updated_at (timestamptz)
└── UNIQUE constraint on (org_id, google_post_name)
```

### Secondary Storage: `schedules` table

Publishing events are tracked in the `schedules` table:

```sql
schedules
├── id (UUID)
├── org_id (UUID)
├── location_id (UUID)
├── target_type ('gbp_post')
├── target_id (text, Google post name)
├── publish_at (timestamptz)
├── status ('published')
├── provider_ref (text, Google post name)
└── created_at, updated_at
```

### Query Examples

**Get all posts for a location:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM gbp_posts
WHERE location_id = 'location-uuid'
ORDER BY google_create_time DESC;
```

**Get live posts only:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM gbp_posts
WHERE org_id = 'org-uuid'
  AND state = 'LIVE'
ORDER BY google_create_time DESC;
```

**Get posts by type:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM gbp_posts
WHERE topic_type = 'EVENT'
  AND event_start_date >= CURRENT_DATE
ORDER BY event_start_date ASC;
```

## Important Notes About the Posts API

### API Availability
⚠️ **The Google Business Profile Posts API has limited availability:**
- Not all Google Business Profile accounts have access
- Test confirmed working for location 16919135625305195332
- If you get 403/404 errors, the account may not have access
- Fallback strategy: Manual posting workflow (future feature)

### Content Validation
Google has strict rules:
- **Summary:** Max 1500 characters
- **EVENT posts:** Must include title and start date
- **OFFER posts:** Must include terms and conditions
- **No prohibited content:** Avoid misleading claims, PII, etc.
- **GBP policies:** Must comply with all Google Business Profile guidelines

### Rate Limits
- **Posts API:** 300 queries per minute
- **Create Posts:** Lower limits (not publicly documented)
- Implement exponential backoff for retries
- Add delays between batch operations

### Multi-Tenant Security
✅ All endpoints enforce:
- Authentication required (valid session)
- Organization membership verification
- Role-based access control (owner/admin/editor)
- RLS policies on database queries
- Encrypted refresh token storage

3. Date picker for EVENT posts
4. Image upload for media (future: integrate Media API)
5. Preview before publishing

### Automation Pipeline
1. Connect to AI generation system
2. Implement approval workflow for autopilot
3. Schedule posts for future publishing
4. Add retry logic for failed posts

### Analytics
1. Fetch post performance data (views, clicks, calls)
2. Store metrics in database
3. Display in dashboard charts
4. Track ROI per location

---

## Production Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Environment variables set (GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET)
- [ ] Database migrations run (gbp_posts table exists)
- [ ] RLS policies enabled and tested
- [ ] Rate limiting implemented for batch operations
- [ ] Error logging configured (Sentry/DataDog)
- [ ] Monitoring for API failures
- [ ] Alert on 3+ consecutive failures per location
- [ ] Backup refresh tokens before migration

---

## Success Metrics

After deployment, monitor:

1. **Sync Success Rate:** Target >95% successful location syncs
2. **Post Creation Success Rate:** Target >95% successful publishes
3. **Error Rate:** Monitor 404/403 errors (API access issues)
4. **Response Times:** Track API latency (<2s p95)
5. **User Adoption:** Track posts created per org per week

---

## Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Posts API not available for location"**
- Google hasn't granted Posts API access to this account
- Solution: Contact Google or use manual posting workflow

**"Failed to decrypt refresh token"**
- Environment variable GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET not set or changed
- Solution: Re-authorize Google connection

**"Access denied - editor role required"**
- User doesn't have sufficient permissions
- Solution: Assign editor/admin/owner role in org settings

**"Invalid summary: contains prohibited content"**
- Post violates Google's content policies
- Solution: Review and remove prohibited terms/claims

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging in test scripts:
```typescript
// In test-posts-direct.ts
console.log('[DEBUG] Request:', JSON.stringify(postData, null, 2));
console.log('[DEBUG] Response:', JSON.stringify(response, null, 2));
```

The library functions in `google-business.ts` already have comprehensive logging.
