# Project Progress

## Completed Work
- Added dual-mode sign-in so users can choose between magic link and email/password authentication, including new UI states and Supabase password handling (`apps/web/src/components/sign-in-form.tsx`, `apps/web/src/app/(auth)/sign-in/page.tsx`).
- Provisioned a confirmed local Supabase user (`jasonfreynolds@gmail.com` / `thematrix`) via the admin API for password logins.
- Fixed Google integration server actions to consume `FormData` correctly, hardened `orgId` parsing, and tightened membership checks with typed Supabase responses (`apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/integrations/google/server-actions.ts`).
- Updated the Google integrations page to await `searchParams`, restored the “Continue with Google” redirect, and added stronger typing for Supabase results (`apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/integrations/google/page.tsx`).
- Adjusted TypeScript configuration/queries so shared dashboard and org pages compile with Next.js 15 type checking (`apps/web/tsconfig.json`, `apps/web/src/app/(dashboard)/page.tsx`, `.../orgs/page.tsx`, `.../orgs/[orgId]/page.tsx`).
- Fully migrated all Supabase helpers to the `@supabase/ssr` clients with async-safe cookie adapters across middleware, server components, server actions, and route handlers (`apps/web/src/lib/supabase-server.ts`, `apps/web/src/middleware.ts`, `apps/web/src/app/**`).
- Reworked Google Business helper typings to avoid missing SDK exports while preserving runtime behavior (`apps/web/src/lib/google-business.ts`).
- Updated the Supabase React provider to satisfy lint/type rules without downgrading runtime safety (`apps/web/src/components/providers/supabase-provider.tsx`).
- Confirmed lint and full production build succeed (`pnpm --filter web lint`, `pnpm --filter web build`).

## Remaining Tasks
- Supply real Google OAuth credentials (`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI`) in `apps/web/.env.local` and finish Google Cloud setup so the OAuth flow can complete.
- Continue wiring live org/GBP data per the roadmap, including dashboard metric sources and Google location pagination polish.
- Implement pagination/loading polish for large Google location lists and refresh `supabase/seed.sql` once managed-location logic is finalized.
- Add integration/E2E test coverage for Google connection flows and managed-location toggles.
