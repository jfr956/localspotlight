# API Investigation History (Archived)

This folder contains the investigation documents that led to the correct understanding of Google Business Profile API capabilities.

## Document Timeline

### 1. `REVIEWS_AND_POSTS_REALITY_CHECK.md`

**Date:** Initial investigation
**Status:** ❌ Incorrect conclusion
**Key Finding:** Concluded that Reviews and Posts APIs were deprecated and returned 404 errors
**Reality:** APIs work fine - just needed proper access approval

### 2. `REVIEWS_API_CORRECTION.md`

**Date:** After deeper research
**Status:** ✅ Correct understanding
**Key Finding:** Discovered that APIs require explicit approval from Google beyond basic OAuth
**Reality:** This was the breakthrough - APIs work with proper approval process

### 3. `CORRECT_API_STATUS_2025.md`

**Date:** Final verification
**Status:** ✅ Confirmed working
**Key Finding:** All APIs functional after enabling `mybusiness.googleapis.com` API
**Reality:** Full automation possible with standard approval process

### 4. `DASHBOARD_DATA_TIMELINE.md`

**Date:** Implementation planning
**Status:** ⚠️ Based on incorrect API understanding
**Key Finding:** Planned for manual workflows due to API limitations
**Reality:** Superseded by correct API understanding

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Google's documentation can be misleading** - doesn't prominently explain approval requirements
2. **404 errors don't mean deprecation** - often indicate access control issues
3. **Competitors use standard APIs** - no secret partnerships required
4. **Investigation process was valuable** - led to correct understanding
