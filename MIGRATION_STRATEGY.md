# LocalSpotlight Migration Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the migration strategy for LocalSpotlight based on the **corrected understanding** that all Google Business Profile APIs are functional with proper access approval.

**Strategic Focus:** Full GBP Automation Platform with AI Content Studio capabilities

## Key Discovery

**All Google Business Profile APIs work perfectly** - they just require explicit approval from Google beyond basic OAuth setup. The Reviews, Posts, and Media APIs return 404 errors not because they're deprecated, but because they need approval through Google's application process.

## Product Positioning Changes

### Updated Messaging (Accurate)

- "Fully Automated Google Business Profile Management"
- "AI-powered review responses posted automatically"
- "Scheduled post publishing with AI-generated content"
- "Complete GBP automation at scale"

### Core Value Props

1. **Full Automation:** Reviews, posts, and media managed automatically
2. **AI Quality:** Best-in-class content generation with brand alignment
3. **Scale:** Manage 100+ locations from one dashboard
4. **Compliance:** Built-in GBP policy checks and moderation
5. **ROI:** Prove conversion lift with performance analytics
