## 1. Business Goals & Success Metrics

### Primary Business Objective

Achieve a **25% average quarter-over-quarter uplift** in target GBP performance metrics for all client organizations actively utilizing the AI generation engine.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

**Conversion Metrics (Priority 1):**

- `ACTIONS_PHONE` - Direct phone calls from GBP
- `ACTIONS_WEBSITE` - Website visits from GBP
- Track via Google Business Profile Performance API

**Operational Metrics (Priority 2):**

- Content generation ‚Üí approval rate
- Time-to-approval (target: <24 hours)
- Scheduled ‚Üí published success rate (target: >95%)
- Per-location content cadence (target: 3-5 posts/week)

**Why These Metrics Matter:**
Traditional SEO metrics (impressions, organic traffic) are declining due to AI search evolution. Focus on **verifiable transactional activity** rather than vanity metrics. The platform's ROI must be demonstrable through direct customer actions.

### Success Measurement Shift

- ‚ùå Don't focus on: Profile views, search impressions alone
- ‚úÖ Do focus on: Phone calls, website clicks, direction requests
- Goal: Prove that AI-generated content drives real business outcomes

## 2. Security & Compliance Requirements

### Multi-Tenant Security (P0 Critical)

**Requirement:** Establish and maintain absolute data isolation between all client organizations at the database level.

**Implementation Pattern:**

```
1. Every table MUST have org_id column
2. RLS policies enforce org_id filtering on ALL queries
3. JWT tokens MUST include org_id claim
4. Zero-trust principle: Never rely on application-layer filtering alone
```

**Security Checklist:**

- [ ] JWT-based authentication with org_id in custom claims
- [ ] RLS policies on every table (no exceptions)
- [ ] Row-level testing: User from Org A cannot access Org B data
- [ ] Audit logging of all cross-org query attempts
- [ ] Service role key protected and never exposed to client
- [ ] Encrypted storage for Google refresh tokens

**Testing Requirements:**

- Write tests that attempt cross-org access and verify denial
- Test with service role to ensure RLS still applies
- Simulate compromised JWT to verify isolation holds
- Test cascade deletes respect org boundaries

### Data Protection

- **PII Handling:** Never invent phone numbers/emails in AI content; redact if necessary in review replies
- **Encryption:** Google refresh tokens must be encrypted at rest
- **Token Rotation:** Implement refresh token rotation; handle revocation gracefully
- **Audit Trail:** Log all AI outputs, approvals, and edits with actor_id

**Success Criteria:** Zero manual effort to generate reports; clients clearly see ROI.

---

## 4. API Management & Rate Limiting

### Google API Strategy

**Challenge:** Google Business Profile API has quotas; managing 100+ profiles risks hitting limits.

**Solutions:**

1. **Request Staggering**

   ```
   - Batch posts across profiles with 30-60 second delays
   - Don't publish to all 100 locations simultaneously
   - Distribute scheduled posts across the hour
   ```

2. **Retry Logic**

   ```
   - Exponential backoff: 1s ‚Üí 2s ‚Üí 4s ‚Üí 8s
   - Max 5 retries per request
   - Move to dead-letter queue after failures
   - Alert admin on persistent failures
   ```

3. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**

   ```
   - If 5 consecutive failures detected ‚Üí pause org's automation
   - Wait 15 minutes before retry
   - Send notification to org admin
   - Log incident for investigation
   ```

4. **Quota Monitoring**
   ```
   - Track daily API usage per org
   - Warn at 70% of daily quota
   - Throttle at 90% of quota
   - Reset counters at midnight UTC
   ```

### OpenAI API Management

**Cost Control:**

- Default to GPT-4o-mini (cheaper, faster)
- Escalate to GPT-4o only for:
  - JSON parse failures after 2 attempts
  - Low confidence scores
  - Complex briefs (>2000 tokens)
- Cache prompt results: hash(prompt + grounding) ‚Üí TTL 7-30 days

**Rate Limits:**

- Batch content generation where possible
- Use streaming for long responses
- Set org-level spending caps
- Alert at 80% of monthly budget

### Compliance Safeguards

**Content Moderation:**

- Run OpenAI's `omni-moderation-latest` on all AI outputs
- Block content flagged as:
  - Hate speech
  - Violence
  - Sexual content
  - Self-harm
- Log moderation failures for review

**GBP Policy Checks:**

- No misleading claims (verify against business data)
- No promotional language in Q&A answers
- Event posts must have valid dates
- Offer posts must have clear terms
- Images meet size/format requirements
- No invented contact info (phone/email)

**Anti-Spam Protection:**

- Limit posts to 5/day per location (Google recommendation)
- Minimum 2-hour gap between posts
- Prevent duplicate content across locations
- Warn if content too similar to recent posts

---

## 5. Operational Excellence

### Background Jobs Architecture

**Critical Jobs:**

1. **Google Sync** (every 6-24 hours)
   - Fetch new reviews, Q&As, media
   - Update location metadata
   - Refresh performance metrics

2. **Content Scheduler** (every 5 minutes)
   - Check for posts with `publish_at <= NOW()`
   - Attempt publishing via adapter
   - Update status and retry on failure

3. **Token Refresh** (daily)
   - Refresh Google OAuth tokens before expiry
   - Rotate and re-encrypt
   - Alert on revocation

4. **Performance Ingest** (nightly)

- Alert on 3+ consecutive failures
- Dashboard showing job health status

### Observability

**Key Metrics to Track:**

- Request latency (p50, p95, p99)
- Error rates by endpoint
- AI generation cost per org
- Content approval velocity
- Publishing success rate
- API quota utilization

**Alerting Thresholds:**

- üö® Critical: RLS bypass attempt, OAuth token leak, 5xx error rate >1%
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: API quota at 80%, job failures >10%, slow queries >2s
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Info: New org signup, high AI costs, unusual usage patterns
